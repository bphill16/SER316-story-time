Once upon a time, there was a person who decided to roadtrip across Germany in a BMW. Singing along to Rammstein the whole way. Two days into their journey, they were driving along the Hauptstrasse when their klimaanlage went out. Luckily they were close to a Biergarten, where they sat down and ordered an Apfelkuchen. Unfortunately, the biergarten was out of Apfelkuchen. However, there was a baeckerei across the street! They decided to go there and order a dozen gebaeck, instead. As they approach the baeckerei, a man in a Lederhose bursts through the door screaming as a tiny hund chases after him, barking furiously. The man ran across the square into the Ratskeller. A woman in a dirndel was just leaving the Ratskeller, but the hund caused the woman to trip. To the woman's dismay (and the hund's delight) her leftover bratwurst went flying as she fell. The hund leaped for the bratwurst, knocking over a cart filled with brot. Seeing this, The hund, being the wettbewerbsf√§hig animal it is, ran over to claim as many brote as it could, before they could be cleaned up.
